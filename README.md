### High Level development talk
      **UI <-> Web Serer <-> Db Repository <-> Db**
      Usually, a practise is that the rest service and UI will be developed in two different repos and that needs to servers for hosting the services. 
      But thinking in the point of convience in deployment for this case, I have merged the UI changes as resources of the springboot app. So that on server is enough to deploy.
